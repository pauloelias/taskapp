# TaskApp

A simple YATDLA (Yet Another To-Do List App™) react app that allows a user to enter in a list of items and delete the items by clicking on the item they want to delete.

Intended to be super simple without any design or styling for now. This is just a small app to help me understand basics of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

## Setup

To view the app you need to:

1. Download the files or clone the repo
2. Change to the “taskapp” directory `$ cd taskapp`
3. Start a local web server and visit the page in your browser

### Serve Project

To start a server locally you can install [NPM’s handy “serve” module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve)

```
$ npm install serve -g
```

Start the server and open the page in your default browser:

```
open http://localhost:8000 && serve -p 8000
```


## Credits

The idea for this app came from the [“Laracasts: Do You React?”](https://laracasts.com/series/do-you-react/) series.
